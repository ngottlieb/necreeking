<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>NECreeking is a website designed to make real-time water level visuals available to everyone. Of course, it only works if people send in visuals. So, if you're driving around to go kayaking (or for any other reason) and catch a look at a river that you think anyone might be interested in level information for, go ahead and report it. Below are detailed steps on how to use the system.</p>

<div class="hero-unit">
	<ol>
		<li>Look at river.</li>
		<li>Send text to <strong>(802) 746-4779</strong>.</li>
		<li>Wait for someone to come meet you at the river, having seen your report in real time on NECreeking.com.</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<p>It's as simple as that. No smartphone needed, just send a plain old text to <strong>(802) 746-4779</strong> and your update will appear on the website in real time. By default, updates are anonymous, but if you want your name or username to appear next to updates you send in, just register an account on the website and input your phone number. We won't show it to anyone, we'll just use it to map your texts to your username.</p>
